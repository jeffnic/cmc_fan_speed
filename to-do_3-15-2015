split_files is working..


separate the workflow like this:

create a main launch file
 - it calls getfanspeed.py
    - creates files with date and fan speed
 - split_files
 - plot_graphs and copy files to webserver

Need to create a page with dynamically generated links  to either display historical data or to create graph on demand
